# Portfolio Code Review

It's time for your first code review. Have your code reviewed (and reviewing other people's code) is a fundamental aspect of being a software developer.

## Why is Code Review Important?

Code review is a crucial part of any development process because:

- It promotes learning within the team, allowing team members to exchange knowledge and ideas.
- You can gain alternative ideas on how to solve a problem that you may not have considered.
- It allows junior developers to learn and contribute, while also sometimes teaching senior developers new tricks.
- It breaks down knowledge silos, meaning the entire team is familiar with more areas of the codebase, reducing risk.
- And yes, it helps catch bugs too!

## Continuos Improvement

As you receive feedback and continue working on your portfolio, make sure to [make a git commit and push to GitHub](/lessons/github-codespaces-vscode#7-save-your-work-with-git) so your repository has the latest changes.

## Requirements

Make sure that your portfolio project has all of the following elements:

- At least one image
- At least three links
- At least three CSS styling rules

- Submit your portfolio project code and have it reviewed by a peer. It should look something like `https://github.com/<username>/portfolio`.
